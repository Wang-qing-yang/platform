Design and Implementation of Multi-unmanned Vehicle Digital Management and Control Platform Based on Unity
The platform is composed of a 3D virtual scene and a human-machine interactiveinterface in Unity. The test object is an unmanned vehicle based on the ROS architecture. Through the two communication methods of serial port and local area network, data interaction with ROS is carried out to obtain the position, attitude and path planning results of unmanned vehicles, which are displayed in the interactive interface, and the unmanned vehicle movement in the virtual scene is driven in real time for 3D visualization

平台由 Unity 中的三维虚拟场景与人机交互界面两部分组成，测试对象为基于 ROS 架构的无人车。通过串口与局域网两种通讯方式与 ROS 进行数据交互，获取无人车的位置、姿态、路径规划结果等数据，显示于交互界面，并且实时驱动虚拟场景中无人车运动，进行三维可视化的显示
